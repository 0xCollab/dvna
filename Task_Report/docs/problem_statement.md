# Problem Statement

* Setup a basic pipeline (use [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/)) for generating a security report for [DVNA](https://github.com/appsecco/dvna).
* The DVNA code should be downloaded from Github and then undergo static analysis.
* As part of the project understand what is the tech stack for DVNA hence what potential static analysis tools can be applied here.
* Once a static analysis is done the report should be saved.
* Next the DVNA should get deployed in a server.
* To do all of the above just consider 2 virtual machines running in your laptop. One VM contains the Jenkins and related infrastructure, and the second VM is for deploying the DVNA using the pipeline.
* Do document extensively in markdown and deploy the documentation in a mkdocs website on the second VM.
